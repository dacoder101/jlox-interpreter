# JLOX Interpreter

It's been a long time since I begun work on this project and I have decided to retire it until I can revisit it from scratch in the future.

JLOX is a interpreted programming language with eventual support for object-oriented programming.

Project was guided by [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) created by Robert Nystrom. Check it out, its pretty cool!
